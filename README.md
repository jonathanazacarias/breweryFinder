This project uses and node/express server to get data from https://www.openbrewerydb.org/ and display breweries to explore. It also taps into the Here maps API to get a map based on the brewery location.
Currently the maps are not displayed, but binary png data for each map is recived.

Create your own .env file to specify port and your Here maps API Key.
